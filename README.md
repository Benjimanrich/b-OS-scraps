# b-OS-scraps
Ideas,scraps and scribbles for a possible(highly unlikely) operating system called b

Just a dump for ideas that i am too unskilled to actually work on and probably never will

called b because of a name i go by but at the same time very shitposty like the :b: emoji
also bees probably, also the precursor to the C language

Gonna take inspiration from unix like systems(very unique), may also add other stuf
Might probably just use Linux for the kernel or not, own init(?).
really wanna make it super modular(maybe not)
since the b language was mentioned might look into something related to that
